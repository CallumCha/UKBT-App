UKBT app for tournaments
=======
### A beach volleyball app to register players for tournaments.

This app will allow users to sign up with a partner for a beach volleyball tournament, and adjust an athlete's ELO based on where they came in the tournament and the level of the tournament.

I wanted to create this App because the current tournament registration and the tournament management itself is a slow process this app will automatically seed players and then create knockout matches based on the results of the pools.

#### ELO ranking 
- ELO is a rating assigned to each player.
- ELO is updated every match you play but will only see these Elo changes at the end of a tournament? Should I display they elo changes for each match ? only if they are in the match?
- On that user's profile page you can see the last 90? 150? 365? days of their elo change. Tournament jump or match jumps?
- Should you see the ELO of everyone who is playing in the tournament?

#### Tournament matches
- Have a 'your matches' chip?
- Display your matches on the home page?
- better layout fot tournament tabs

#### Rankings
- Show everyones ELO on the UKBT
- you and your position at the top with ability to jump to your position.

#### Home Screen
- your upcoming tournaments (within month)
- upcoming matches within day?

#### Matches
- Referee team
- Score rather than win or loss
