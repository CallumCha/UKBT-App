UKBT app for tournaments
=======

### A beach volleyball app to register players for tournaments.

This app will allow users to sign up with a partner for a beach volleyball tournament, and adjust an athlete's ELO based on where they came in the tournament and the level of the tournament.

I wanted to create this App because the current tournament registration and the tournament management itself is a slow process this app will automatically seed players and then create knockout matches based on the results of the pools.

#### ELO ranking 
- ~~ELO is a rating assigned to each player.~~
- ~~ELO is updated every match you play but will only see these Elo changes at the end of a tournament?~~ Should I display they elo changes for each match ? only if they are in the match?
- ~~On that user's profile page you can see the last 90? 150? 365? days of their elo change. Tournament jump or match jumps?~~
- Should you see the ELO of everyone who is playing in the tournament?
